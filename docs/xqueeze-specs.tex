Usage of the \textbf{Specification} in this document for developing an
\textbf{Implementation} is subject to the following terms and conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An \textbf{Implementation} advertizing itself to be based on the
  \textbf{Specification} should support the provisions of the
  \textbf{Specification} in whole or partially, provided it also
  fulfils condition 4.
\item An \textbf{Implementation} advertizing itself to be conforming
  to the Specification should put into effect the provisions of the

\section{xqML language}

xqML is the binary markup language that is used by Xqueeze to achieve
compact document sizes as compared to XML documents. xqML is
structurally very similar to XML. The greatest contributors to xqML's
compact nature are the elimination of redundant information and
representation of XML identifiers (NMTOKENs) whose definitions are
available in the DTD/Schema with binary \textit{xqML Symbols}.

\subsection{xqML Grammar (Revision \xqMLver{})} \label{section:xqml-gram}
\input{xqML-grammar.tex}

\section{Xqueeze Association}

Xqueeze uses an association between symbols and their corresponding
XML identifiers and types as defined in a specification
(DTD/Schema). This enables representation of known identifiers in the
markup with symbols. Associating the type of an identifier along with
it's name also makes it easy to various structural units of the
document without having to use too many special characters and
character-combinations.

\section{Changes}

\subsection{xqML}
\subsubsection{Revision 4} \label{subsubsection:changesRev4}
\begin{itemize}
\item xqML will now have ``Revisions'' instead of version numbers. The
  current format can report a maximum of 255 revisions. However, this
  does not imply that there will not be more than 255 revisions of
  xqML
\item Comments have now been dropped
\item CDATA Sections have now been dropped
\item The format now allows for generation of documents without prior
  knowledge of schema through {\it Dynamic Associations} (\S{}
  \ref{pr:RegId})
\item The {\it xqMLDecl} represents xqML revision information in
  binary now
\item A new terminal {\it Rev} has been added
\item {\it xqMLDecl} is now mandatory for all xqML documents
\item All xqML documents have the value of special attribute
  ``standalone'' as ``no''
\item {\it ELFlags} production added to combine three flags related to
  elements into one octet
\item {\it ATAttribute} ends with `\{0x16\}' instead of
  `\{0x1E\}\{0x16\}'
\item A new terminal and xqML Symbol type, {\it VUint} has been added
  (see \S{} \ref{section:xqMLSymbols})
\item {\it CharRef} now uses VUint to encode the character's code
  point value
\item The production {\it EE\_STag} has been dropped
\item {\it ETag} now uses `\{0x30\}' instead of `\{0x3E\}'.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Version 0.3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Anything is permissible upto the occurrence of \textit{xqMLDecl}
  in a document
\item A new production, \textit{PI}, has been added for Processing
  Instructions
\item \textit{doctypedecl} now starts with `\{0x1E\}\{0x2C\}' instead
  of `\{0x1E\}\{0x12\}'
\item \textit{xqA} should necessarily include a prolog now
\item \textit{doctypedecl} may now have an inline DTD with a new
  production \textit{DTDSect}.
\item \textit{element} production was erroneous till the last
  version
\item A new prodcution \textit{NSPrefix} has been added for XML
  Namespace prefixes
\item The productions \textit{EE\_STag}, \textit{STag},
  \textit{ATAttribute}, \textit{APAttribute} and \textit{EntityRef}
  can now have namespace prefixes
\item \textit{EE\_STag} starts with `\{0x1E\}\{0x2A\}' instead of
  `\{0x1E\}'
\item \textit{ATAttribute} starts with `\{0x16\}' instead of
  `\{0x1E\}'
\item \textit{APAttribute} starts with `\{0x18\}' instead of
  `\{0x1E\}'
\item \textit{EntityRef} starts with `\{0x1E\}\{0x24\}' instead of
  `\{0x1E\}'
\item \textit{CDSect} starts with `\{0x1E\}\{0x28\}' instead of
  \textit{CDDelim} and ends with `\{0x1E\}' instead of
  \textit{CDDelim} (\{0x1E\}\{0x14\}).
\item \textit{Char} now matches the \textit{Char} production in XML
  1.0 grammar specification.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Version 0.2}
\begin{itemize}
\item xqML Symbol `\{0x1E\}' replaces `$<$' for the latter's role in
  xqML markup
\item \textit{Attribute} is split into \textit{ATAttribute} and
  \textit{APAttribute}, together referred as \textit{attribute}.
\item \textit{ATAttribute} can contain \textit{Reference}.
\item \textit{ATAttribute} is terminated by `\{0x1E\}\{0x16\}' instead of
  `$<$'
\item \textit{CharRef} starts with `\{0x1E\}\{0x26\}' instead of
  `\&\{0x26\}'
\item \textit{CharRef} ends with `\{0x1E\}'. Earlier there was no
  end-marker
\item \textit{Comment} ends with `\{0x1E\}' instead of \textit{ETag?}
\item \textit{Comment} is deprecated
\item \textit{Char} is a terminal that matches any printable character
\item \textit{Num} does not contain `.'
\end{itemize}

  44 decimal values up. For example, the symbol for Element section is
  now `\{0x30\}' (48) instead of `\{0x04\}' (04).
